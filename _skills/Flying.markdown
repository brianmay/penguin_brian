I first [started flying]({{ site.baseurl }}/hobbies/Flying/)
in 1998, and obtained my Private Pilots
License (PPL) in October 1999. The PPL allows me to fly light aircraft such as
Piper Warriors and Piper Archers. I am allowed to fly anywhere in Australia, as
long it is daylight and I keep out of clouds.
