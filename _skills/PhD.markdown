I have a PhD in computer access control, including authentication protocols
such as [Kerberos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos) and authorisation
protocols such as
[SPKI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_public_key_infrastructure). I
obtained my PhD in 2002 from [Monash University in
Clayton](http://monash.edu.au/campuses/clayton/).

For my PhD I submitted papers at various conferences, including:

* [MADE2000]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2000-05-30-MADE2000 %})
* [WCC2000]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2000-08-25-WCC2000 %})

The Phd is available for [download]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/phdthesis.ps).

Errata:

* Page 7, Line 13: “This thesis addresses three issues” should 
  read “This thesis addresses these three problems”.

* Page 7, Line 6 from bottom: “not secret, but must be kept 
  secure”. To clarify, secret means no one else has access to it, 
  and secure means no one else can alter it.

* Page 8, Line 4 from bottom: Just to clarify that the work 
  mentioned was done by me.

* Page 9, Line 3: change “a criteria” to “a criterion”.

* Page 9, Line 4: change “references” to “literature”.

* Page 9, Line 6: change “Also, the system should be secure” to 
  read “Moreover, the system implementing the protocol should 
  contain no loopholes”.

* Page 10, Line 2: Change “The next chapter introduces the basic 
  concepts behind access control, and how it is made up of 
  authentication and authorisation.” to read “Chapter two 
  introduces the basic concepts of access control, and explains 
  how access control is formed in terms of authentication and 
  authorization.”

* Page 11, Line 11: Change “This was” to “This work was”.

* Page 12, Line 7: Change “During the course of this research 
  conducted with relation to this thesis, much of the work has 
  been published as academic research papers.” to “Most of the 
  research results related to this thesis have either been 
  published or been submitted for publication.”
