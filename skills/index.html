<p>I ensure my skills remain up-to-date by constantly researching new solutions
for old problems and attending
<a href='{{ "/conferences/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}'>Conferences</a>
right around the globe.</p>

<p>I hold skills in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
    {% for skill in site.skills %}
    <li>
        <a href="{{ skill.url }}">{{ skill.title }}</a>:
        {{ skill.description }}
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
