Newspaper article on previous road_accidents I have mentioned here. There were
two separate accidents on Mount Dandenong Road, the same corner
I [lost control](@/posts/2007-03-08-Lost_control.md) and as [another car](@/posts/2007-03-16-Another_car.md). The road was closed off for most of the afternoon.
