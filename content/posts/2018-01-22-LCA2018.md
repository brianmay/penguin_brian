# LCA2018

In 2018 I attended LCA2018 and gave a talk on Robotica. Mum and the three
kids we are caring for also came to Sydney with me.

See details of the [trip](@/posts/2018-01-22-Sydney.md).

This conference was very good, as always, with some very good talks. Some
notable talks:

- [Is the 370 the worst bus route in Sydney?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7jqU39wvKk)
- [Tap On to Reverse Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVvNdfKRw7M).
- [Manage all your tasks with TaskWarrior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl68asL9jZA).
