## Money

5 or 6 months of fund raising.

Raising money in USA for Australian project is difficult. Australia is not a common thought in USA.

Australia is acknowledged as cheaper to operate in then USA or Europe. Half the
cost of North America.

## Challenges

Got to know 25 US VMware customers and there problems, and how much there were
prepared to pay for a solution. Potential customers for VC. The most
important part of raising the money.

## Technology

EvoStor Technology

## Marketing

Make a bang. Get feedback from potential customers.
