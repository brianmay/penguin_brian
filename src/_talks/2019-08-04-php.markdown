What PHP learned from Python 2 to Python 3 transition.

As developers we prefer green fields. If nobody upgrades, does the new
version really exist?

People who develop tooling/libraries need to be able to support both
versions.

Maintain syntax, even if this doesn't make sense. Need to
support transitioning from one way to the other.
