time_t is long - 32 bit signed number on 32 bit machines.

Didn't want to break 64 bit API, but fixing it might have been easier.
time_t should have been defined as long long - 64 bit signed number.

Use time64_t instead of time_t.

First patch 4 lines changed. Revised change after feedback, numerous files
changed and driver dropped.
