Wave in Plone.

PlonieBot. Uses the Python API.

1. User creates new wave
2. User adds robot to wave.
3. Form appears, and user fills it in.

PlonieBot will be open source.

XMLRPC cleanest approach. Supported by Drupal, Hoomla, Wordpress, etc. Could
have use JSON, etc, instead.

OpenAusBot. Make information on government publicly accessible.
