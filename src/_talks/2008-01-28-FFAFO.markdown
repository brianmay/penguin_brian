multichannel audio interfaces now use firewire

FreeBob was renamed to FFADO. FreeBob had limited hardware support,
and only supported some BeBob devices.

Lack of manufacturer support an issue.

Rewrite of the ieee1394 kernel driver to fix a number of problems.

## Status

Things work, but with restrictions.

Timing accuracy, some devices are more picky with timetables of samples.

Need to support more devices.

* lack of driver specifications
* $1500 - $3000 per device

No releases yet, subversion downloads only.
