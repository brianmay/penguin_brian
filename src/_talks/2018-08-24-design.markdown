Design for Non-Designers
------------------------

Fonts
=====
Keep number of fonts low. Two fonts good rule of thumb.

Use fancy/display fonts sparingly.

Vary weights, style, etc rather then different fonts.

* Google fonts.
* Beautiful web type.
* Typewolf.
* fontpair.co

Whitespace
==========
Very important and trendy to have whitespace wher required.

Whitespace makes it easier for people to see elements and use
your website.

Reduce visual clutter, aim for clean design.


User Experience
===============
Most important action on your design? Make it easy to find and use.


Data and Analytics
==================
Pay attention to your goals. Make sure it is working the way you
want it to.


Content
=======
Less content, short and more concise, the more likely somebody is going to read
it.

Big paragraphs sign of clutter.


Images
======

Small, not too big.

* unsplash.com
* photopin.com
* favert.com
* local designer, e.g. appcanary

Imitation
=========
Look at other designs for inspiration. Don't steal, but be inspired.

Conclusion
==========
Practise, practise, practise.
