Configuration Management

Large number of like hosts ... that are somehow never alike.

Documentation; no documentation - no idea what I did that for. Stick documentation in wiki, so anybody can edit.

Track changes - Software configuration management.

CMDB - configuration management database.

Configuration managent tools:

* closed source solutions: Tivoli (does a lot of things but not very well)
* open source solutions better: Puppet

Puppet is:

* free
* client server model
* secure SSL communication
* unix centric
* supports external databases and LDAP for configuration
* extensible
* ruby
* windows not supported; flat files are supported; windows requires API calls, reboots, etc.
* open application
* declarative language
* relational, define relationships
* transactional - roll back changes - not yet fully implemented
* <http://reductivelabs.com/PuppetModules>
* Language: Define arrays, variables, conditionals
* not monoloithic model; does a better job

Remove inventory tool.

push and pull model supported
