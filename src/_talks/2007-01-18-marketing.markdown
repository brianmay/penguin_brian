3 types of projects

* scratch own itch, solve own problem
* Benign and neglect, moving direction of team, not users.
* user-centric

Marketing can't solve problem with software

bullet slide bad, one item per slide good.

Marketing isn't always bad:

* bring in new users
* bring in new developers
* share code

Traditional methods don't work for FOSS

Word of mouth, presentations, write articles, press, webpage

* good postgresql, vim.

Do:

* embrace non-developers
* Debian mainlainer application
* process developer centric

Don't "just grab code from {CVS,subversion}"

* source tarball with clear instructions
* distro specific package
* wmare package

Do:

* good documentation important
* aimed at non-developers

Don't:

* say nasty things about competitor's programs
* people don't like to be told that their stupid for using Windows
* positive not negative

Don't say "we will release when ready"

* predictable releases

## Press

1. introduce yourself
2. be sincere
3. send updates
4. have a reliable press contact
5. don't flame: "You lost all credibility" - DON'T!!
   * sends messaege "don't write about our project or you will get flamed by
     wierdos"
6. Become the media - get a planet
7. Good luck

## Marketing

virial marketing

* hard for floss if at saturation point among FOSS fans

developers

* stand back
* don't bite users
* not gods

users

* promote software, too.

How to deal with negative views

* honest, refuse interview
* don't go on defensive
* don't feed the trolls
* don't link to the article
