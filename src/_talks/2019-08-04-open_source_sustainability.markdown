Throwing money at open source projects not always a solution for
sustainability problem.

Open source projects don't know what to do with it, where to keep it,
or how to deal with taxation implications.

Not asked if they want the money.

We have been conditioned: money == sustainability.

We go and reinvent the wheel. Open source sustainability is a special
problem, only we can solve it.

We should look at the corporate world.

The [Brundtland Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Common_Future).

* Contains definition of sustainability.
* See definition of ecosystem.

Interlocked problems:

1. Poverty reduction.
2. Wealth redistribution.
3. Gender equality.

Not possible to look at just one problem. All problems have to be addressed
or none.

Sustainability not simple or easy.

Paying maintainers good. However paying maintainers isn't a solution
to sustainability by itself. Need three elements:

1. Contributing back. What does this mean? Time, Talent, Treasure.
2. Human and environmental diversity.
3. Community safety. "We don't do that here."

Vendor lock down == risk for company. Use OSS instead.

OSS creates single point of failure too, and is risk for company.

1. Determine which project(s) are important to you.
2. Evaluate the success and longevity needs of that project.
