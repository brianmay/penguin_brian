Mirages. Projects that appear to be common well supported packages, but
only supported by relatively few people.

Burnout.

Most projects fail because people don't want to work on them anymore.

Phases: Dread, guilt, abandonment.

What went wrong?

Lots of technology built with relatively few volunteers.

You can only build one thing at a time.

Best case will always be more users then contributors.

Over time, more people getting value out of system then they are putting back
into the system.

Wrong turns.

Once off contributors. Takes a lot of effort to shepherd one person through
process for just one contribution, even if contribution is important.
