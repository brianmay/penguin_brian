## Command Line Management of 
Duncan Lorry  
Intelligent Platform Management Interface

## Machine Automation tools
?????

core of project stable for a couple of years  
programmable logic controllers  
proprietary buses  
"loyalty schemes"


## RMD Machine Documentation
Sam  
literate programming  
vim, bash, etc  
MID document source code  
hyper-links, HTML, fonts, etc  
viewcvs integrated  
plain-text, integrates with CVS easily

## Supersize pages on the Itanium
Lucy  
something fairly simple: speed  
virtual addresses --> physical addresses

* conversions using page table
* wasted cycles fetching these tables
* each and every address needs a page address translation buffer
* can cache in TLB, but TLB is expensive
* only one translation, prevent wasted cycles

nothing yet done for Linux  
users not aware of it happening, except greater speed with config option turned on  
Gelato web page

## X11 Print System
Dew Parsons  
Debian Maintainer: X11 Print system, gworldglobe  
printing system designed to fit into X  
layer between application application and print service  
applications can use X print API to print pages  
x print allows printing properly  
full internationalisation  
CSS style sheets  
PDF documents  
Mozilla xprint aware  
xprt-xprint.org

## Wine desktop integration program
James Gregory  
win applications look like gnome applications  
plug in based theme system  
motivation, wine is cool, but hard to make it do anything  
goto webpage

## Open business applications
Ron Skyo  
new platform  
driver for issue, real problem with X and latency (not Telstra's fault)  
migration path to Linux.  
reduced 4000 basic program to 400 lines  
framework will be realised on Mozilla type license, approx August  

## RTL8.81 MIPS, 2 PCI, 2 Ethernet, wireless
Grant Defi  
Access point  
A friend of mine got one of these  
2 access points bridging Ethernet  
uploaded new firewire via web interface  
Linux + Busybox + etc  
could you please send us the source? No  
But you need to do this, see GPL.  
They contacted the OEM  
"Please send us the copy of the source that contradicts the GPL"  
They got the development environment, and put it on the web.  
powerful and fun  
Ethernet attached wireless network devices  
not enough ram for dynamic routing  
some of the source, working on the rest of it

## Software Suspend in Linux
Burnard  
was buggy 1 year ago which could trash file systems

patch to kernel and script  
NRDs
