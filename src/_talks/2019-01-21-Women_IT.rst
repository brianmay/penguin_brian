Under 20% women in IT.

Only hired because boss thought female employee would stop male employees
from swearing.

Desperate times call for desperate measures.

Don't give too much credibility to job descriptions.

Number 1 enemy: recruiter.

Number 2 enemy: self.

Job description important. Minimum requirements. Don't put technologies that
are not relevant.
