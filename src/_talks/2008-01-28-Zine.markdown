Security sign all files in repository and add md5sum/sha1
at end of file, with GnuPG signature.

Signing is independent of revision control system, so signatures
can be checked even if files are in outside revision control system.

Signatures dependant on file type. Only C and C++ files currently
supported.

Auto generated files should have signatures.
