Different priorities between developers and system administrators.

Developers, build as much as they can.

Sysadmin, try to get good night sleep.

DevOps: What is inside the package you want me to deploy?

DevOps: Rolled back the build. Due to error at 1am. Rollback worked,
therefore, I think it was your code. Technically QA's fault.
