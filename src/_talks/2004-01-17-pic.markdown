PIC = Position Independent Code

*    = Pilot in Command
*    = Penguin in Car
* ???

testing 1 2

* leader for PPTP and Netrek
* Software engineering
* went bush 1999
* work for HP
* Unix/VMS support

Hobby

* PIC Microcontrollers
* Linux world domination market
* fun
* small gadgets cool
* skills required
* not that difficult or expensive
* bike light blink you email address in Morse code

microcontroller

* this one dead
* small
* RS232
* closed source silicon
* instructions well documented
* lots of nice tools on Linux
* 8 pin to 40 pin
* package type sometimes legs come out sideways
* you can get it to do things
* very must,
* not much power
* RISC
* 35 instructions
* data, code in separate memories
* won't run Linux
* one register
* 12C309, 12F84, 12FS877
* 8k program memory
* $3, $12, $45
* flash or EPROM
* ram registers

PCBs

* non-free eagle
* can cut without chemicals

safety

* ware safety glasses, in case of exploding components
* check earth pins connecting, prevent 120V static build up

device programmer, to program chip via serial port

* plug chip into device to test, distribution phase

design

* paper and xcircuit
* xcircuit, vi like, slow to learn easy to use
* Dia
* GNU EDA
* xspread
* non-free program better?

source code

* vi, emacs
* gpasm
* sdcc - small device c compiler
* picforth - forth compiler
* make
* gpsim - GTK+ GUI for simulating PIC, faster then PIC itself

programming

* picprg - IO programmer
* prog84 - parallel port /dev/port
* odyssey - new, last 1-3 weeks, everything for everybody

programmers

* Kitsrus Kit 96
  * free fly on connector
* Asa Micros
  * also comes with free fly
  * serial port
* Dontronics DT001
  * serial support to PIC
  * dontronics.com
  * $20 - $30 dollars
* can't replace parallel IO port on laptop
* external power supply required

resources

* PIClist - high volume list
  * subject line policing
  * proprietary people, can't always help
* GNU PIC
  * proponents open source
* #electronics on freenode

skipper

* open source program allows disabled access to computer
* suck & blow interface
* sponsored by Microsoft

projects

* light box
* chin control arm trigger
  * raise and lower chin control arm
* radio controlled train
  * cable remote
  * cable span around kid until plug pulled out
  * speed control of motor via radio control
* Cachlear implant centre
  * light up bays of toys randomly
  * avoid frequency of implant
* Speedometer
  * requires laptop for display
  * powered by serial port
  * curses program for displaying speed
  * data comes from PIC, delays in timing on laptop don't matter
  * interrupts on PIC
  * on interrupt every bit transmission time on PIC
* random led flasher
  * whats that for?
  * its blinking; its working
  * why does it need to have a better reason
* temperature sensor --> serial line
  * printed circuit board
  * made into kit
  * open source
  * 2400 bps
  * Gnuplot
  * after demonstration of measuring body temperature: therefore I am not cool
* serial terminal, LCD panel, keypad
* irrigation controller
  * keep context after reset
* pump controller
  * pump water from well
  * once we got it going, it sucked
* alarm control, 24 hour clock
  * easy to set
  * type in time
  * serial port and temperature sensor
  * quietly wakes you with a soft beep
* PIC Stack Match Package
  * all open source
* everything is open source
