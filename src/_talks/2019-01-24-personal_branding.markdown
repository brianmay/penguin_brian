Impostor Syndrome.

Never give up.

No source of information for beginners. This was missing. I become this
resource for beginners.

Personal brand

Nobody is competition. They are people you can learn from.

If you don't control and manage your brand, others will do it for you.

Especially if they don't agree with you.

Protect yourself.

Targeted harassment. Keep notes, screen shots, etc. Know who to contact.

Code of conduct.

Trolls. "You don't belong here."

Response: "My accomplishments speak for themselves."
