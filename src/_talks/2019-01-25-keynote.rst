Why would we go to a Linux conference? Most people into Linux students or
hobbyist. Hard to sell.

Conference needs speakers. Speakers need to be paid.

200 people showed up. In middle of winter.

No network. No wifi. Somebody printed out slashdot on daily basis and posted
copy on notice bird. No video.

Conference T-shirts.

Lesson. Never again.

Andrew Tridgell.

Projects happen:

* People smart enough to complete them.
* People dumb enough to try.

"That sounds great! Tell me more!"

"What can I do to help?"

"Enable people enthusiasm."

Collaboration is a super power.

"This is not where you belong."
