50+ jobs with "Community Manager" in the description.

Not just open source "Community Manager".

Different types of "Community Manager". Lots of community manager's
don't like their title.

Community Managers: An old job. Every time you get a bunch of people
together. What has changed, is that it is online now.

different reasons.

Do we need community managers?

Can you *prevent* community managers?

Community managers are responsible for:

How are these done?

* A lot of different things are done.
* Interpreter - speaking different languages, depending on who you are talking to.

questions, others find the most appropriate person to answer questions.
* Conferences, chatting to people face-to-face
* Worry about product and community.
* Dealing with trolls, everyone has a story about a troll, and how they
got rid of them. Infrequent, but can be stressful.
* Community manager own strategy? No, but aware of what it is and trying
to make it happen.

Where should the community manager fit within the company?

Different views.

* Marketing, but nobody should know
* Engineering

be paid, but online and answering technical support queries.

* fun and friendly
* leaders - lead the community in direction
* multi-tasking, lots of things happening at the same time.
* talking different "languages" - tech speak vs end user language
* think of job as "social worker", ensure community is healthy

More women in community management then open source.

Women failed to take promotion because there would be no more
women role models for existing staff in technical positions.

How to become a community manager:

* participate lots
* give talks, even to small group of people
  * "I don't have anything to talk about" - then make up something.
  * Start a blog, even about your bog - way of communicating.
  * Write lots, start a journal if you aren't ready to start a blog.
  * Communicate, communicate, communicate.

## Questions

Real metrics to measure success of managers required.

Evolution of community manager, usually from technical background. Evolving
into a marketing role.

Communities will have a manager regardless of if somebody pays for it
or not. Getting the right person is the hardest part. Create your own job.

As a volunteer, proof of concept - look at how much further I can go
if paid full time - depends if community has a benefactor who would
be willing to invest for some sort of return.

Community groups, own sort of group structure.

Company advocate for project.

Flow of communication in from community must be equal to flow out from
community. In is harder then out. Otherwise its just one group telling the
other group what to do.

PR not mentioned in talk? PR - Public Relations - marketing role.

For larger companies, this can be outside their comfort zones.

Community manager must get respect from community, and from company.  Building
respect from both companies is walking a very fine line, and difficult. Need to
show judgement, even handedly, and with consideration.

Community manager needs to be authentic, and reflect actual
direction of company and upper management, otherwise may loose respect
from community.
