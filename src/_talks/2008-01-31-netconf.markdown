netconf could mean:

* RFC4741, the NETCONF protocol, save/store network configuration.
* The miniconference at LCA
* Internal/proprietary produce

Why?

* ifupdown aging
* requires hooks
* very stateful, can get out of sync with reality.
* not extensible, eg. wireless support limited.
* single interface, no dependancies, limited.
* other distros have there own requirements.
* network manager, requires a GUI, GUI-centric design. Backends limited,
eg to one IP address per interface, no bonding, bridging, etc.
* netconf will be able to interface to networkmanager, network
manager will continue working.

The vision:

* bottom up; start with smallest thing, keep it simple, keep it modular.
* event based system
* decisions are decided based on policy
* stateless as much as possible; not entirely possible, eg. dhcp client.
* do not get in the way of the administrator
* daemon calls shell scripts to do the manipulation.
* cross distro support. gentoo does network stuff better then Debian.
* non-root bring up interfaces if policy allows.
* integrate with resolv.conf management, firewalling, link-status (netlink).
* no magic

Road map in git repository.

* replace ifupdown in Debian.
* implement a policy layer, authenticate non-root users.
* listen to netlink events and react. Make ifplugd obsolete.
* If driver is broken, it won't work.
* link detection happens eclusively via the Netlink socket.
* tacking link down on any interface should really activate power save mode.
