Take UI from desktop and make it work on mobile. Really bad idea. Everything
is touch base. Touch is very course. When you touch you cover the thing you
are touching with your finger.

* QML
* Kirigami - layer on top of QML.

Still not entirely happy with outcome. Tempting to switch to native Java
application. Tradeoff however means we can't share code.

A lot of frustration. However a lot of success too.

Flutter???
