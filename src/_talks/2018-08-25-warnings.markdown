PEP230.

Warnings:

* Deprecated features. It might get removed in future.
* Things that could be a problem now.
* Things that are wrong in 3rd party code.

Command line switch ``-Waction``. Default is not the default. Standard setting
has a log of warnings disabled.

Environment variable. ``export PYTHONWARNINGS=action``.

Don't mix strings and bytes for keys. Use ``-bb`` to make this an error.

Python 3.7 depreaction warnings should interactively and in main, but only for
current project, not 3rd party libraries.
