## Latency - Google
Google platforms team, latency talk, GMail should be fast. Most likely
problem is between application and disk on client computer. Filesystem
overhead. Block layer, reorders things to make it more optimal. Long
I/O, generates long queues, waiting for other work to be done first.
Google works, by having lots of hardware, but low utilization, we
are trying to improve this. Drivers, reduce CPU utilization, reduce
notifications when hardware is finished. Firmware is doing something
else, and does not care about the IO. Environmental issues.
