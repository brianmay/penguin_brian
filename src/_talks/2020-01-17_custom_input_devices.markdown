It costs a lot to be disabled.

Lack of competition. Lots of regulation. Lack of innovation.

Wheelchair Chris uses is $42,000.

China, not so much regulation, lots of innovation, modern technology.

Heaters no longer available from manufacturer, and were very expensive.

Arduino Leonardo

Wheel chair control. Voice control.

No longer possible for person to say "Ok Google" after operation, can
only say 2 syllables.
