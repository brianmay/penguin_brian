JIT manufacturing. Manufacture things just in time.

Minimize waste, minimize costs.

JIT compilers. Compile when needed, don't need to compile code that is never
used.

JIT learning.

1. Write code.
2. Hit issue.
3. Define problem.
4. Find a solution.
5. Goto 1.

Sometimes this doesn't work.

Assumption: You will ask the required questions.

Counter examples:

* Accessibility.
* Race conditions.
* Proprietary software.
* Statistics.

Agile: The benefit of getting it done now outweighs the cost of getting it wrong.

What if cost of mistake is private data leakage? Or other security issue?
