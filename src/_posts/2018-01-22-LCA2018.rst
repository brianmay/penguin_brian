LCA2018
=======

In 2018 I attended LCA2018 and gave a talk on Robotica. Mum and the three
kids we are caring for also came to Sydney with me.

See details of the `trip <{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-22-Sydney %}>`_.

This conference was very good, as always, with some very good talks. Some
notable talks:

* `Is the 370 the worst bus route in Sydney? <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7jqU39wvKk>`_
* `Tap On to Reverse Engineering <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVvNdfKRw7M>`_.
* `Manage all your tasks with TaskWarrior <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl68asL9jZA>`_.

The talk I gave:

* `Robotica - Robot maid for assisting with autistic kids <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCUpShC9Cs8&t=16s>`_.
