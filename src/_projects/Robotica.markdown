Robotica is a series of Raspberry Pis throughout the house make annoucements
and otherwise try to assist looking after Autistic kids. Initially Robotica was
written in Python using asyncio, then it was written using Elixir and Nerves.

Gradually the code is being replaced by code written in rust, although there
are still somes significant parts only written in Elixir.
