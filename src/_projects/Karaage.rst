Karaage is a Python/Django project. The first git commit was made in 2008.

The purpose of Karaage was to automate our manual processes for creating and
managing cluster users.

After I was made redundant at VPAC, I gave a talk at PyCon AU 2015 on
`Karaage Gardening <{{ site.baseurl }}/talks/2015-07-31-karaage/>`_.

See posts on `Karaage <{{site.baseurl}}/tag/Karaage/>`_.
