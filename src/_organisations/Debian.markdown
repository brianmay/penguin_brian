Debian is a global effort made by volunteers to create an operating system
based on Linux.

I am a debian developer and currently maintain these packages:

* [heimdal](http://packages.debian.org/src:heimdal): Implementation of Kerberos 5.
* [amavisd-new](http://packages.debian.org/src:amavisd-new): E-Mail virus scanning.
* [dar](http://packages.debian.org/src:dar): Enhanced version of tar, intended for backups.
