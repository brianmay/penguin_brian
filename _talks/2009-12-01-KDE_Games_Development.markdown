One person on their own can't do everything:

* artwork
* sound affects
* i18n and i10n
* menus
* config
* documentation
* tutorials, information, etc
* support for users: email, bug reports, IRC, aKademy, blogs, news sheets.

Talk about common desktop, bringing Gnome and KDE together.

The "coder decides" rule (a free-for-all ... ?)

KDE 4:

* Dolphin - file manager.
* Phonon - sound system.
* Solid - hardware management.
* Nepomuk/Strigi - meta data, uses RDF triples, for data files.
* Plasma Desktop and Workspace. <http://aseigo.blogspot.com/>. Design you own desktop.
* All games must use SVG graphics.
* KDE 4 libraries very different from KDE 3, large parts of applications may need rewriting.

Programs:

* kgoldrunner package. Clone of Lode Runner.
* kmymoney2
* digiKam
* Gwenview
* palapeli
* kigo - front end to gnugo - chess.
