<http://swfdec.freedesktop.org> - free flash player - not done yet.

Why write a flash player?

* I want flash to go away.
* Liberate content.

Content

* things we work on
* all the things we ever did

Content gets lost

* Discussions we forget?
* Put it on the internet? Store it locally?

Hard to access

* Content restrictions: DRM, etc
* Difficult protocols: Flash, etc
* Obsolete media: VHS tapes, etc
* Obsolete/changing file formats: game demos, firefox history, etc

Awareness. Who

* does backups?
* saves blog posts locally? (when posting to remote server)
* knows browser.history\_expire\_days?
* bash expiration history

Freedom vs freeness

* take the best tool of the job
* flash not free; in 5 years time you may not be able to play
your old files anymore.

Awareness: We only care when we encounter problems. What is my password?

Content vs. Culture

* MPAA vs "amateurs".
* Flash vs HTML
* .NET/Java vs JS/PHP/Python/etc
* Bytecode vs open code
* Byte code "nobody can steal my code"; open code: other people can study code.
* GPL - free user; BSD - free developer

If in doubt, fix the future.

HTML5 support for video formats.
