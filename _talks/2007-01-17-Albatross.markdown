UAV - unpiloted aerial vehicle

non-military applications

navigation easy

control loop difficult - 20Hz

## Hardware v1.0

200 grmaes

FPGA unideal

* Magnetic field (compass)
* Gravity (accelerometer)

Sensors

* Accelerometers * 3
* Pressure sensors - altitude and airspeed
* GPS
* radio (serial data modem)

4 Layer PCB

* hand soldered SMC

single process model = reduced kernel overheads

C++

FPU important

## Hardware v2.0

1/2 size

30 grams

Satellite radio 10 grams

## Future

Fly to NZ

less then 5kg (customs legal requirements)
