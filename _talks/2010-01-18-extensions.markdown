## Gadgets

Non-textual stuff in waves. Bring more meaning, by making it visual and non-text.

Concurrent editing. Gadget needs to highlight who edits what, cursor position,
etc.

Gadget should clearly show what your state is, as well as other participants
state.

Viewing mode - read only - no state edits - privacy mode - user's can see who
is looking at page.

Edit mode - editing toolbar - no longer anonymous - changes affect global
state.

## Robots

Bad example: cartoony, translates all text into image, prevents edits, removes
collaboration.

You shouldn't require a special language for robot usage, instead parse natural
text. Different robots will end up with different syntax, that may not be human
readable. Don't treat Wave as the command line. Symantic analysis.
