Teaching Python Online to Primary Students
==========================================
Gifted Online - Tasmania

* Funded by Dept of Education, delivered by teachers with time
  release.

* Classroom teachers nominated gifted students.

* Students have 'support person' in their school. Could be done via class.

Australian Curriculum mandates coding K-8. Few primary schools are in a
position to teach it.

Highly gifted kids bored and problematic in classrooms. Teacher may not
realize that they are gifted.

Equity. Students learning at home. Those without social/family connections
are disadvantaged.

CodeXX - online version of scratch.

Courses dominated by boys. Students picked by teachers. Teachers likely to pick
problematic students, who were more likely to be boys. Girls also likely to be
bored, but show it in a different way. Solution: Course for girls. Force
teachers to pick girls.

Challanges:

* Get more girls enrolled in Python.

* Getting the right students into the courses. Teachers aren't good at picking
  the right students.

* Student Resilicence.

* Code quality. Poor quality code can be accepted by grok. Students want to
  continue, not revise old work.

* Communication an issue with online teaching.

* Sufficient access. 1 hour per week is not enough. In practise 1 hour is
  reduced or missed frequently. Successful kids continue in their own time.
