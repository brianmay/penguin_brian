Program all the things
======================
Most of work should be done by cloud service or application.

Neopixels - chaining.

Built in neopixel class in micropython.

External libraries. Upload mpy file.

SSD1306 - external library.

Communications. HTTP easiest.

Live demos are dodgy.

Red lights look angry. Worth changing to blue even if it stuffs up your live
demo.

MQTT better for some applications. Simpler.
