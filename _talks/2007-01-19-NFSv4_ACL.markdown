POSIX ACLs (withdrawn draft standard)

Windows ACLs

NFSv4 ACLs

Traditional nix permission model

Posix ACLs

* draft standard withdrawn
* read, write, execute
* compatible with traditional permissions
* not setuid/setgid

CIFS ACLs (aka NTFS ACLs)

* Samba maps CIFs ACLs to/from POSIX ACLs.

NFSv4 ACLs

* modelled from CIFS
* RFC3530
* interaction with POSIX poorly defined
* Linux NFSv4 maps NFSv4 to/from POSIX
* CIFs wierdness (some) gone
* IETF standard

Netapp/EMC NAS

* last mode set wins
* POSIX permission model + CIFS ACLs

Samba 4

* store ACL as EAs

UFS2, GPFS, ZFS

NFSv4 ACLs

    for every permission
        for every ACL item in list
            if permission granted or denied
                set as given
                break
            else
                continue searching
            end
        end
    end

unix permissions

rwx---rwx: owner: allow; everyone allow; everyone has full privileges  
owner and group restricted

setuid/setgid- not ACLs

needs to be incorporated into kernel, proprietary code
