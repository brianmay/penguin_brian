Users want simplicity.

e.g. "remove item" should not be default menu item.

e.g. Only the bare minimum controls:

* compose mail, send mail, forward mail, reply mail, delete mail
* no folders support
* all other controls should get hidden and not displayed
* different levels of users: beginners, ..., advanced, ...: Linus Torvalds

Managers want:

* plans, even if never done
* road maps, not needed for open source, as everything is open

Different categories of users

* home users
* small business users, use consultant
* large business users?
