Fibre feed from AARNET POP B to Cisco 500G.

Cisco 500G hopeless to configure.

Cisco fed a Dell Optiplex gateway.

Registration desk ran inside DMZ network, so it would still function even if router failed.

Allocate /21 (8 class C)

Divide into /22 (4 class C)

169.222.8.0/23 DHCP
169.222.12.0/24 servers/DMZ
169.222.13.0/28 switches
169.222.15.0/24 spare

Cisco 500G won't support VLANs,

WRT54GL running Kamikazi firmware.
