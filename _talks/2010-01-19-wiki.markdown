Don't have very complicted access control lists, unless you have to. See a
spelling mistake and fix it.

If somebody makes a bad edit, it can be reverted.

Lookup the wiki even though you know the procedure. Ensure ISO 9000 compliance.

Problems:

* Duplication due to bad filing. Use search to find duplicates.
* Old documents.
* Different systems used. Management pick one.
