240V --> switchboard --> switch --> light

CBUS

240V --> switchboard --> CBUS relay  --> switches/button
                         or dimmer   --> lights

CAT5, but not Ethernet

Motorola HC05 (a few years ago)

32.5V DC to power light switched
4KHz

infrared sensor, light sensors, serial interface, Ethernet interface

buttons assigned to group numbers
output channels assigned to groups

long press, increase brightness
short press, decrease brightness

all off button

1 light = switch1 or switch2
1 light = switch1 and switch2

ASCII serial commands

serial sniffing
send stuff, receive stuff
Intel hex dump, looks similar
address data checksum

information on clips website

cost to get started

$3000 for first switch

standard house with wiring, $5000 for system to be installed.
ceiling fans, power points
used to control Christmas tree
Dynalite, similar system, open protocol
X10??? no intelligence, just the protocol
X10 sensors are expensive
Need Australian models, are legal in Australia.
X10 is slower

open hardware project???

$30 per cheap switch
$100 per light switch

soft dimmer, increase brightness gradually, increase globe life
relays noisy, but required for fluorescent lights

Oscar, extension on alarm control system, not very good

heating/cooling, yes, if via 240V interface

turn lights on/off from the comfort of your mobile phone

reliability
single point of failure, switch board
can have two switch boards
hit by lightning could cause problems
two wires
