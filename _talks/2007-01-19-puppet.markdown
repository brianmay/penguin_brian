This is the solution you have all been looking for.

    for host in ...; do
        ssh $host function
    done

cfengine

* closed product
* author won't accept patches
* assumptions by author
* open source

puppet

* no unreasonable assumptions
* assume you can type
* other assumptions probably bugs
* huge problem
* no one else would scratch my itch

1. configuration language
2. client/server tools
3. portable resource abstraction layer
   * modelling layer
   * provider layer

Package providers:

* dpkg
* apt
* aptitude
* etc

users - use LDAP, not puppet - except system users

puppet as a tool

* made assumptions

configurations

* idempotent
* can run 15 minutes or manually or
* reporting

written in ruby
