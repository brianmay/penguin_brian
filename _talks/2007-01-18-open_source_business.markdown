Starting a successful business

A brief tour of hell

Most customers don't care about FOSS

* low upfront costs

Why?

* control destiny
* may end up with less money/time (if not careful)

business cards

social skills with non-geeks (normal people)

effective communications

* client sees talking not the work

client with bad code: "This code looks novel, never thought of doing it that
way, lets try ...."

difficult clients generate most work:

* special clients
* everything is an emergency
* penalty rates

intermediary clients

* no access to end clients

Hand difficult clients to somebody else looking for work

System administration

* no closure - continuous process
* most work is dull
* can't be picky when starting

planned 2 hours a day, actual 12 hours a day.

clients need constant support; no holidays

can't charge for all hours worked
