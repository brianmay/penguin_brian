Take credit for your work. It is expected. Don't be modest.

CC patches to *big* mailing lists.

Social skills important as well as technical skills.

Take credit fot things you don't do (add maintainer name code reviewed).

PCI

PCI X - faster bus speed.

PCIe - different but pretends to be similar; message bus, not shared bus.

lspci

* 00:00.0
  * 00 - bus
  * 00 - device on bus
  * 0 - function
* vendor code, sub vendor code, sub device code.
* 8086 Intel = 86-08

IRQS A, B, C, D get mapped to IRQs.

* setpci
* if BIOS doesn't make changes (very unlikely), changes are persistant across
reboots.
