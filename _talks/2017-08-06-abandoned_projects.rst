How to handle abandoned projects, Take Two
==========================================
The context matters. Why was the project abandoned? What is the story?

* Github fork limitations.
* Licensing. Different defaults for different cloud providers.
* Old code needs to be updated or die. Security concerns. EOL
  languages/features.
* Python 2.7 EOL in 2 years 7 months 6 days 15 hours 29 minutes.
* Python 3 supports emoji.
* Porting Python 2.7 to Python 3 important.
* Any project needs attention.
* Hostile forks don't help anyone.
* Abandon responsibly. Update documentation. Mark it as inactive. Link to a
  better solution.
* No Maintenance Intended.
* Transfer ownership.
