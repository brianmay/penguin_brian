Arduino applications on clothes.

Applications

* Health and safety. Baby monitor. Monitor elderly. Moving? Heart beating?
* Assisted living.
* Location awareness. GPS doesn't work inside buildings. House set temperature
depending on where you are.
* Notification.
* Performance. Sports.
* Environmental monitoring / control.

Sensors

* buttons
* temperature
* accelerometer
* gyroscopes
* pressure
* etc

Wires that can be sewn on to garments are either thick (and require old sewing
machine) or thin (and have high resistance - especially a problem with high
current as ohms law says there will be a large voltage drop). Other options
might be available.
