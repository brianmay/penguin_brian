On handheld we can synchronise:

* E-Mail
* Contacts
* Calendaring
* Files: Music, Ring tones, etc
* Photo of person calling

I want to synchronise with my Linux desktop.

Buzzword compliant technologies:

* XML
* AJAX - not web based
* Java - never works properly
* Gopher??
* Enterprise in the name
* Phone has Atomic transactions - Java DB

Read only devices, e.g. ipod, simple to implement.

Windows Mobile phone works best; Windows Mobile 6 is
Windows Mobile 5 with some updates. Windows Mobile is
custom version of Windows CE customized for phone.

## Fumamble

* Not Client/server architecture via 3rd party website. This is bad.
* Client/server architecture via installable daemon.
* Limited documentation. Interface to server: Java GUI Application
via X forwarding.
* upgrade instructions; reinstall from scratch; devices will copy
data to server again.
* open source
* not CPU intensive
* Outlook plugin also exists
* Backups of phone easy

Synchronisation:

1. synchronise phone with server
2. sync-evolution to synchronise evolution with server
3. synchronise phone with server

# Conclusion

It does work with bugs; not flawless but close.

Run daemon as its one user; probably has numerous security issues.

Alternatives:

* Open Exchange
* Zimbra
* Microsoft Exchange

Microsoft products really good until marketing find out.
