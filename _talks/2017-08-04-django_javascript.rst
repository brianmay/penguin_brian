Django & JavaScript
===================

History
-------
* ECMAScript 4 never standardised.
* jQuery.
* Template libraries. Some inspired by Django template language.
* Frameworks. AngularJS, etc.
* Seperate templates required for Django and JS.
* Django Compressor and Django Pipeline.
* Django REST framework, Tastypie.
* ECMAScript 6 - officially called ECMAScript 2015.
* Transpilation. For the impatient. Run ECMAScript 6 in ECMAScript 5.
* Angular2 -> Angular, Angular 1 -> AngularJS.
* React + Redux.
* NPM, bower, Yarn. Most people use NPM, as means you can use one tool.
* Grunt, Gulp, Browserify, Rollup, Webpack.
* Typescript, Flow.

ECMAScript 6
------------
* Let/const instead of var.
* String interpolation.
* Multi line strings.
* Arrow functions.
* Module imports.
* Classes.
* Default values for parameters.
* You don't need to try out every new feature.

Django
------
* Django webpack loader. Less invasive then Django Pipline.
* Decouple frontend and backend.
* Single page application.
* Automatic provisioning.
* Django has excellent documentation.
* Python react.
* Django channels.
* Django as a microservice.

Which one?
----------
* Building a website or webapp?
* JS for decorative or functional purposes?
* Do you need batteries included? If using framework, need to respect their
  decisions?

Competition: node.js
--------------------
* Contenders:

  * sails.js (closest to Django).
  * Meteor.
  * Keystone.

* Smaller communities, less mature.
* One language.
* First class async support.
* Isomorphic render.
* Websockets - good support.

Future
------
* New functionality all the time.
* Notification APIs. Push notifications to phone.
* Offline Django.
* Django and JS are good friends.
