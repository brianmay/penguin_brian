Xinerama - multiple monitors

VidModeExtenions - change mode for each monitor and size of screen

history of X:

* number of screens fixed at server startup
* can't move window between screens (windows; pixmaps)
* resources per screen

Xinerama

* move application between screen
* resources duplicated for every monitor - resource hungry
* not dynamic
* windows duplicated for each screen (byt only visible on one)

XFree86

* VidModeExtension
* Shift+Alt+[+-]


Multiple graphics cards should be supported

RandR

* rotate screen
* landscape to/from portrait
* size changes need to be exposed to applications
* no rotation in XFree86 (would have required driver changes)
* Static

5 versions of xinerama in CVS repository (each driver, etc)

Virtual screen - "real screen"

* displays map and display sections from the virtual screen
* Max size 2048x2048 - xaa limit

Problems

* XAA - stale
* DRI separate memory management
