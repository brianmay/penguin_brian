In September 2005 we had a holiday along The Great Ocean Road.

# The Great Ocean Road

In May this year, we went to see stay at
{% include photo_place.html place=198 link="Cobden Crest Cottage" %}, near
{% include photo_place.html place=196 link="The Great Ocean Road" %}.

It was a great place to stay, but unfortunately, the locals didn't understand
any english. They kept repeating the same word over and over, I think it sounded
like "MOOOoooooo."

The Cobden Creat Cottage came complete with Kitchen, Bedrooms and Games rooms.

We saw the road to nowhere. This road use to be the main road, and was to close
to the cliff, and as such the road was relocated.

We saw history behind General Motors Holden.

... as well as some incredible views of the coast.

Some of the tourist attractions had lots of steps to climb up and down.

Some of the waves were very big, and had a dramatic effect as they came in. It
is hard to capture on camera.

We also visited the nearby chocolate factory and the cheese factory. We saw the
Lochness Cow outside the cheese factory. Unfortunately Dad was too slow, and
didn't see it. The photo is not a fake.
