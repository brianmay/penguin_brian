Trip to Hobart and then Numurkah
================================
In early 2017 I had a conference at Hobart,
I drove down in my Telsa Model S after crossing to Tasmania in the ferry.
After the conference I visited `Numurkah
<https://hcg.vponline.com.au/resort/profile.aspx?ResortID=16>`_ for a week.

See details of the conference `LCA2017 <{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-01-16-LCA2017 %}>`_.

Hobart
------
I have been to Hobart for a number of conferences (LCA2009, PyConAu2012,
PyConAu2013). Normally I fly. However this time I wanted to do something
different.  The problem was, once I get to Hobart, where can I recharge for the
return trip? I worked out I would need to charge at least twice, once
when I first got to Hobart, and once just before leaving.

Planing
~~~~~~~
Plugshare is the de facto default standard for listing EV chargers across
Australia. In Hobart it lists three options:

* MONA: Museum of Old and New Art. They have 2 single phase 32 amp chargers
  available for patrons. I wanted to visit MONA once, however not multiple
  times.

* RACT Hobart Apartment Hotel. They only have one charger. I was lead to
  believe that they use it to charge their `Nissan Leaf
  <https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/1667760/>`_, and as such it may not be
  available for my use. I tried contacting them however got no response.

* Hobart Central Carpark. Limited availability. Not suitable.

I was given the suggestion that I should contact Wrest Point. However
they were unable to assist.

Then, as I was about to abandon my plans, I got `this response
<https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/1767120/>`_. Turns out that Derek
Mitchell is a Tesla fanatic in Hobart, and he is willing to let me use his
charger. Problem solved. Thanks Darek!

I planned to use the night Ferry, because that would allow me to drive to
Hobart during the day. I did not want to do much driving during night hours,
due to increased possibility of running into wildlife.

Day 1 - Friday 13th
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I intended to charge the car (as normal) the night before, only forgot. Oops.
Not a problem, I was intending to do a 100% charge at the supercharger
near Richmond anyway. I started charging at 5pm, and it said expected
time to completion 6:10pm. At 6:20pm there was still no signs of completion
and the charge current had dropped to 3 amps. So considering I wasn't going
to get much more then 448 km typical range anyway and the ferry boarding time
was 6pm (or was that 6:30pm???), I decided to stop there.

At the Ferry terminal, I got confused. There was a sign that said boarding time
was 6:00pm (it was 6:30pm), and pointed to the right. Was it pointing at the
locked gate? Or back the way I came? Eventually I managed to work out that the
ferry was running late, I didn't get the SMS notification, and that boarding
would start until 8:30pm (actually was 8:00pm).

Unfortunately, due to the delay in check-in time, I had to pay for several hours
parking, which was something I had hoped to avoid. Seems like I should have
continued charging my car to 100.00% after all.

I tried to stay out of my car as much as possible, to preserve battery.

The Ferry didn't arrive until almost 9pm. I didn't get to board the Ferry until
11pm, and it wasn't until sometime after midnight when we departed. So much for
the 9pm departure time.

On my Tesla I turned on Range mode and then turned off "always connected" to
try and preserve battery power. I also tried to turn off air conditioning as
much as possible.

I ended up parking on the bottom floor on the ferry.

Day 2 - Saturday 14th
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The delays meant I could sleep in the next day. Scheduled arrival at Devonport
was 6am, I finally got off ship closer to 11am. My 448km charge had now gone to
434km, this included 10.1km drive from Richmond, and loses during the night.

I had a 30 minute break at Campbell Town, near the playground. The I proceeded
to MONA. At MONA I had 159km remaining. I charged for 3 hours 47 minutes (until
closing time), and this increased to 289. A complete charge would have taken 8+
hours (The MONA charger appears to be single phase only, so around 37km/h
charging), so it was a good thing I wasn't dependant on charging at MONA. I
drove into Hobart, and continued charging to 403km (overnight) using Darek's
charger.

Day 3 - Sunday 15th
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I drove into Richmond, looked around the place. Got slightly sunburnt. Looked
at the miniature 1800s version of Hobart, and the old gaol. Took lots of
photos.

Next day I had to get up early for the conference. In consulting with Darek, we
agreed a recharge was not required.

Day 4 to 8 - Monday to Friday
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I drove back and forward between my accommodation to Wrest Point on a daily
basis. No dramas.

I started receiving alerts about a software update for my car, however postponed
the update until after I got back.

Day 9 - Saturday
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Didn't do a lot. Went to the local market, which was a short walk away. My car
was down to 279km. Charged this up to 100% overnight using Darek's charger.

Day 10 - Sunday
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Drove back to Devonport. Uneventful. Was really early, so I went to the Mersey
Bluff Lighthouse for a while. In doing so I got confused with the navigation
instructions from my car and took the exit before the Mersey River bridge, not
the exit after. The navigation system is confusing when there are two exits
close together. I ended up joing the Highway going back the way I came,
exiting, reentering in the same direction, and almost making the same mistake
again.

Lined up to get on the ferry at 6:30pm, exactly. Was front in the queue. Then
found out the ferry was running late. Yet again I didn't receive an SMS.
Check-in not due to open until 8pm.  Fortunately I was able to leave my car in
the queue, as long as I returned by 7:45pm. It wasn't until 9:43pm until I was
finally on board the ferry.

While waiting, the car decided to go to sleep. I found it wouldn't wake up
again when I needed to move. I had to get out the drivers door and get back in
again to wake it up. Maybe just opening and closing the door would have been
sufficient too.

This time they put me on the 6th floor, the top floor. 120km left on battery,
and I had driven 301.8km (including driving around Devonport).

Day 11 - Monday
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we got back to our cars, they wanted us to get in our cars. Unfortunately
the left hand side of the car was hard against the rails on the side of level
6, and the right hand side of the car was too close to the cars in the adjacent
lane. Exactly were I had been told to park in Hobart. So I was unable to open
any doors. I had to wait, standing on the deck, for them to move the car
blocking my door out of the way first.

When I did get into my car, I noticed I had 118k battery remaining. I drove
straight to the Tesla supercharger, where I had 111km remaining. I parked
in what looked like a free supercharger, only to find it was a gap between
parking spots for the entrance to the Tesla building. All the superchargers
were in use. Fortunately I didn't have to wait long. I proceeded to charge
to 100% in preparation for my trip to Numurkah.


Numurkah
--------
We had a holiday house booked in Numurkah.  Unfortunately, for this stage we
had 6 people, and only room for 5 in my car. So we had to take two cars (one
being a petrol car).

Numurkah is North on the supercharger at Euroa. So I planed to travel
on the Hume Freeway to get there. It is possible to drive from the Richmond
supercharger to Euroa almost entirely on freeways. The car navigation
thought it would be better to drive through the city. I disagreed, and
went my way via city link, Bolte Bridge, Tullamarine Freeway, and the
Western Ring Road.

At Euroa supercharger, I parked rear end first into the spot on the right of
the charger. Before realizing that the cable was on the other side, and
wouldn't reach. I wasn't the only one to do this. So I parked in the left
spot, and found the cable was really tight, however I got a connection. I
charged to 100% from 267km, as this was going to be the last chance to charge
for the week.

At Numurkah we visited various places through the week, including The Big
Strawberry, Glenarron Farms, and on the return trip, the Chocolate Apple
Factory.

On the return trip, my car was down to 106km at Euroa. I noticed for both my
trips, there was another car charging at the same time as me for at least part
of the time, so I tend to agree when others say 2 chargers isn't enough. We
weren't ready to leave after it finished charging, so I relocated my car and
found that almost all parking spaces were taken.

Telsa
-----
I tested and tried out some of the advanced driving features of the Tesla.

Auto speed limit detect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most of the time the Tesla is good at detecting the speed limit, however
there are times it consistently gets it wrong.

* School speed limits. Often it will detect 40km/h at start (regardless of
  time) and then several seconds later revert back to previous speed limit.

* Road works in school speed limit areas produces lots of confusion.

* 80km/h is occasionally misread as 30km/h.

* 80km/h electronic signs on City link are often misread as 60km/h.

* Monash Freeway has 90km/h speed limits for trucks only which are incorrectly
  read.

* Black "End 60" and "60 Ahead" signs are read incorrectly as 60km/h speed
  limit signs.

* Sometimes it will suddenly come up with a slower speed limit for no
  apparent reason. Or if there was a reason, I completely missed it.

* If the speed limit has changed in the last several years it can get confused
  and sometimes display the new speed limit and sometimes display the old speed
  limit.

Autopilot
~~~~~~~~~
I found autopilot worked pretty good most of the time, however there were times
it got a bit closer then I would have liked to the oncoming traffic, so I
manually override it by steering to the left. On some rare occasions when I let
it have its way (when I can see that there was no conflicting traffic) it
incorrectly crosses the lanes. Especially on lower quality highways with
sharper corners in the lanes.

It also seemed to have problems when overtaking lanes ended, in that it would
sometimes jerk unnecessarily or speed up. On one occasion I indicated right as
I was approaching a T intersection, and auto steer interpreted that as a
request to change lanes into the oncoming traffic. NO!!! In all cases I was
alert and overrode as required.  

As per documentation, Autopilot works better on two lane divided freeways.
However you still do need to be alert even on dual lane divided roads.  I found
that if driving at 110km/h on autopilot and passing a stopped car, autopilot
suddenly limits the top speed to 80km/h and starts reducing speed.  Which is
very much unexpected behaviour.

Also as a sobering thought, I came over the crest of a hill at 110km/h to see a
parked car on the side. This was fine, it was close to the road, but I could
get past. However there was a person standing on the road, looked like he was
about to open the car door. I had to cross the over to the wrong side (I could
see there were no oncoming cars) to ensure I didn't hit this person. Autopilot
probably would not have been so forgiving.


Conclusion
----------
During my trip I experienced range anxiety on a constant basis, aliens
invaded and replaced the President of USA with a lunatic, ... oh wait ...
the truth ...

This is the longest trip I have been on so far with my Telsa and I had no major
dramas. I never got below 106km remaining on the battery, and never experienced
anything close to range anxiety. There are currently much fewer charge points
then there are petrol stations, and as a result you do need to plan where your
next recharge will be and how much driving you will make before you reach it.
